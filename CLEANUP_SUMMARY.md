# Repository Cleanup Summary

## Cleanup Operations Completed

### 1. Root Directory Cleanup
**Deleted 53 test/analysis/profiling files:**
- All `test_*.py` files (performance tests, integration tests)
- All `profile_*.py` files (profiling scripts)
- All `analyze_*.py` files (analysis scripts)
- All `benchmark_*.py` files (benchmarking scripts)
- All `verify_*.py`, `check_*.py` files (verification/debugging)
- All `compare_*.py`, `visualize_*.py` files (comparison/visualization)
- All `explain_*.py` files (explanation scripts)
- Implementation roadmaps and investigation summaries
- Generated PNG images from analysis

### 2. JAX Directory Cleanup (`jax_full_src/`)
**Deleted 16 test/debug files:**
- All `test_*.py` files
- `debug_tree_v2.py`
- Removed entire `test/` directory
- Removed `test_plot/` directory

**Archived 17 outdated but working files to `archive/`:**
- Early implementations: `simple_*.py` files
- Outdated MCTS versions: `mctx_style_*.py`, `tree_based_mcts.py`
- Early board implementations: `efficient_board*.py`, `improved_board.py`
- Outdated neural network: `vectorized_nn_fixed.py`
- Early evaluation files: `evaluation_fast.py`, `evaluation_simple.py`

### 3. Documentation Cleanup
Removed redundant/outdated documentation while preserving key files:
- **Preserved**: README.md, JAX_VS_PYTORCH_PIPELINE_COMPARISON.md, MCTX_PIPELINE_UPDATE_SUMMARY.md, MCTX_ANALYSIS_SUMMARY.md
- **Removed**: Various analysis and comparison documents

## Final Repository Structure

### Root Directory (`/workspace/alphazero_clique/`)
- Core documentation files (README, key summaries)
- Original PyTorch implementation (`src/`)
- Experiment results (`experiments/`)
- Requirements and setup files
- No Python files in root (all test/analysis files removed)

### JAX Implementation (`/workspace/alphazero_clique/jax_full_src/`)
**Active/Current Files:**
- `run_jax_optimized.py` - Main entry point with MCTX
- `run_jax_improved.py` - Alternative entry point
- `mctx_final_optimized.py` - Final optimized MCTS implementation
- `vectorized_board.py` - Current board implementation
- `vectorized_nn.py` - Current neural network
- `vectorized_self_play_fixed.py` - Current self-play
- `train_jax.py` - Training logic
- `evaluation_jax.py` - Evaluation logic

**Archive Directory (`archive/`):**
- All outdated implementations preserved for reference
- Early versions of MCTS, board, and neural network
- Test files from earlier development

## Benefits of Cleanup

1. **Clarity**: Only the most current, working implementations remain visible
2. **Reduced Confusion**: No multiple versions of the same functionality
3. **Clean History**: Outdated code preserved in archive for reference
4. **Focus**: Clear separation between production code and experiments

## Experiments Folder Cleanup

### Additional cleanup performed on experiments folder:
- **Analyzed**: 99 experiment directories
- **Deleted**: 64 empty/broken experiments
  - All debug_* experiments (no data)
  - All empty test_* runs
  - Failed GPU tests
  - Incomplete runs with only config files
- **Preserved**: 35 experiments with actual data
  - 16 training experiments (complete runs)
  - 14 test experiments (with results)
  - 5 demo experiments

### Remaining experiments are organized as:
- **Key training runs**: n6k3_mctx_medium_training, jax_improved, symmetric_25iter
- **Comparison tests**: comparison_test, test_mctx_pipeline
- **Performance tests**: pytorch_speed_test, jax_speed_test_*

## Next Steps

The repository is now clean and organized with:
- PyTorch implementation in `src/`
- JAX implementation with MCTX in `jax_full_src/`
- Only meaningful experiments preserved in `experiments/`
- Clear documentation of the optimization journey

Ready for production use or further development!
