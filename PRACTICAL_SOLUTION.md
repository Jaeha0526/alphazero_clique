# Practical Solution for JAX AlphaZero

## The Reality

After extensive analysis, here's what we found:

### Performance Comparison (20 MCTS simulations)
- **PyTorch**: 0.014s (1ms per NN call)
- **JAX Fixed Tree**: 1.117s (35ms per NN call) - **80x slower**
- **JAX Batched**: ~0.9s (still slow and buggy)
- **JAX Broken**: 0.035s (but doesn't work)

### Root Cause
JAX is **35x slower** than PyTorch for single neural network forward passes on CPU:
- PyTorch: 0.7ms per inference
- JAX: 35ms per inference

This is because:
1. JAX is optimized for large-scale GPU/TPU operations, not small CPU models
2. PyTorch has better CPU optimizations for small batches
3. JAX's compilation overhead doesn't pay off for single examples

## Recommended Solutions

### Option 1: Hybrid Approach (Recommended)
Use the best tool for each job:

```python
# Self-play: Use PyTorch (fast MCTS)
games = pytorch_self_play()

# Training: Use JAX (fast batch training)  
model = jax_train(games)

# Convert models between frameworks as needed
```

**Pros**: 
- Fast self-play with correct MCTS
- Fast training with JAX's optimizations
- Both parts work well

**Cons**: 
- Need to maintain two codebases
- Model conversion overhead

### Option 2: Parallel Games
Don't try to speed up single MCTS - run many games in parallel:

```python
# Instead of: 1 game with 100 simulations (slow)
# Do: 20 games with 5 simulations each (fast)

# Each game gets its own independent MCTS tree
# Trees are small but correct
# Overall throughput is much higher
```

**Pros**:
- Stays in JAX ecosystem
- Correct MCTS algorithm
- Better GPU utilization

**Cons**:
- Each individual game is weaker (fewer simulations)
- May need more total games for same quality

### Option 3: Accept the Speed
Use the fixed tree-based MCTS but with optimizations:

```python
# Reduce simulations during training
training_games: 10-20 simulations (weaker but faster)
evaluation_games: 50-100 simulations (stronger but slower)

# Run on GPU cluster if available
# JAX shines with proper hardware
```

**Pros**:
- Algorithmically correct
- Single codebase
- Will be fast on proper hardware (GPU/TPU)

**Cons**:
- Very slow on CPU
- Need significant compute resources

## NOT Recommended

### ❌ Don't Use the Broken Vectorized MCTS
- It's not actually doing tree search
- Model can't improve beyond random play
- Fast but fundamentally wrong

### ❌ Don't Try to Over-Optimize Tree Search
- Tree search is inherently sequential
- Complex batching introduces bugs
- Diminishing returns on optimization effort

## Conclusion

The most practical solution depends on your constraints:

1. **If you need to stay in JAX**: Use parallel games with fewer simulations
2. **If you want best performance**: Use PyTorch for self-play, JAX for training
3. **If you have GPUs/TPUs**: The slow JAX version will be fine
4. **If this is research**: Accept the slowness for correctness

The fundamental issue is that JAX isn't designed for the type of computation MCTS requires (sequential, single-example, CPU-based). The "broken" fast version worked around this by not doing MCTS at all, which is why training failed.

Sometimes the correct algorithm is just slower, and that's okay if it actually works!
