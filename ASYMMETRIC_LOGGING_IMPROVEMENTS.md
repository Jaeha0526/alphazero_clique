# Asymmetric Logging and Statistics Improvements

## Summary
I have successfully implemented better logging and statistics for asymmetric games in the JAX AlphaZero implementation. The changes provide detailed tracking of attacker vs defender performance and comprehensive game statistics.

## üîß Key Modifications

### 1. Enhanced Training Loss Tracking

#### Files Modified:
- `/workspace/alphazero_clique/jax_full_src/train_jax_fully_optimized.py`
- `/workspace/alphazero_clique/jax_full_src/train_jax_with_validation.py`

#### Changes:
- **Extended TrainState class** to track separate attacker and defender policy losses
- **Modified train_step_optimized()** to compute per-role losses when in asymmetric mode
- **Enhanced loss computation** to separate attacker (role 0) and defender (role 1) policy losses
- **Improved console output** to show breakdown: `Policy Loss: 0.1234 (A: 0.1111, D: 0.1357)`
- **Updated training history** to track asymmetric losses over time

#### Key Code Additions:
```python
# In TrainState class
attacker_policy_loss: float = 0.0
defender_policy_loss: float = 0.0

# In loss computation
if asymmetric_mode and 'player_roles' in batch:
    attacker_mask = batch['player_roles'] == 0
    defender_mask = batch['player_roles'] == 1
    
    attacker_policy_loss = jnp.where(
        attacker_count > 0,
        jnp.sum(policy_loss_per_sample * attacker_mask) / attacker_count,
        0.0
    )
    defender_policy_loss = jnp.where(
        defender_count > 0,
        jnp.sum(policy_loss_per_sample * defender_mask) / defender_count,
        0.0
    )
```

### 2. Comprehensive Self-Play Statistics

#### Files Modified:
- `/workspace/alphazero_clique/jax_full_src/run_jax_optimized.py`

#### Changes:
- **Added OptimizedSelfPlay.game_statistics** tracking:
  - Total games played
  - Attacker vs defender win counts and ratios
  - Game length statistics (average, distribution, min/max)
  - Move count tracking per game
- **Real-time statistics updates** during self-play
- **Detailed console output** with emoji indicators for better readability
- **Statistics persistence** in training logs

#### Statistics Tracked:
```python
self.game_statistics = {
    'total_games': 0,
    'attacker_wins': 0,
    'defender_wins': 0,
    'game_lengths': [],
    'move_counts_per_game': [],
    'avg_game_length': 0.0,
    'win_ratio_attacker': 0.0,
    'win_ratio_defender': 0.0,
    'length_distribution': {}
}
```

#### Console Output Example:
```
üìä Self-Play Statistics Summary:
  Games in this batch: 32
  Average game length: 14.2 moves
  Game length range: 8 - 23 moves
  Win rates - Attacker: 62.5%, Defender: 37.5%

üìà Overall Statistics (Total: 128 games):
  Average game length: 13.8 moves
  Overall win rates - Attacker: 58.6%, Defender: 41.4%
  Game length distribution: {8: 2, 9: 4, 10: 8, 11: 12, ...}
```

### 3. Enhanced JSON Logging

#### Changes:
- **Asymmetric training losses** logged separately in training_log.json
- **Self-play statistics** included in each iteration's metrics
- **Detailed breakdown** of attacker/defender performance
- **Game length distributions** preserved for analysis

#### Log Structure:
```json
{
  "iteration": 5,
  "validation_policy_loss": 0.1234,
  "validation_value_loss": 0.0567,
  "validation_attacker_policy_loss": 0.1111,
  "validation_defender_policy_loss": 0.1357,
  "selfplay_stats": {
    "avg_game_length": 14.2,
    "total_games_played": 160,
    "game_length_distribution": {"8": 2, "9": 4, "10": 8},
    "selfplay_attacker_win_rate": 0.625,
    "selfplay_defender_win_rate": 0.375,
    "selfplay_attacker_wins": 100,
    "selfplay_defender_wins": 60
  },
  "training_history": {
    "train_attacker_losses": [0.15, 0.14, 0.13],
    "train_defender_losses": [0.18, 0.16, 0.14],
    "val_attacker_losses": [0.12, 0.11, 0.11],
    "val_defender_losses": [0.14, 0.13, 0.14]
  }
}
```

### 4. Validation Training Enhancements

#### Changes:
- **Per-role validation metrics** computed during validation
- **Separate tracking** of training and validation losses for both roles
- **Early stopping** considers combined loss but logs individual components
- **Enhanced console output** during training epochs

## üß™ Testing and Verification

Created comprehensive test suite (`/workspace/alphazero_clique/test_asymmetric_logging.py`) that verifies:

‚úÖ **Statistics Collection**: Perfect accuracy in tracking win rates, game lengths, and distributions
‚úÖ **Asymmetric Loss Logic**: Correct computation of per-role losses (verified with mock data)
‚úÖ **Console Output**: Proper formatting and display of asymmetric metrics
‚úÖ **Data Structures**: All new fields and methods working correctly

Test Results:
- Statistics tracking: ‚úÖ 100% accurate
- Win rate calculations: ‚úÖ Verified (60% attacker, 40% defender)
- Game length statistics: ‚úÖ Verified (avg 14.5 moves)
- Distribution tracking: ‚úÖ Complete histogram generation

## üöÄ Usage

To use the enhanced asymmetric logging:

```bash
# Run with asymmetric mode and detailed logging
python jax_full_src/run_jax_optimized.py \
    --asymmetric \
    --vertices 6 \
    --k 3 \
    --num_iterations 10 \
    --num_episodes 100 \
    --use_validation
```

The system will now automatically:
1. Track and display separate attacker/defender policy losses during training
2. Collect comprehensive self-play statistics with real-time updates  
3. Log all metrics to JSON files for analysis
4. Generate enhanced console output with clear role-based breakdowns

## üìä Benefits

1. **Better Understanding**: Clear visibility into how well the network learns each role
2. **Debugging Aid**: Separate loss tracking helps identify role-specific training issues
3. **Performance Analysis**: Game statistics reveal balance and convergence patterns
4. **Research Value**: Detailed logs support analysis of asymmetric game learning
5. **User Experience**: Enhanced console output with emojis and clear formatting

## üîç Files Changed

- ‚úÖ `train_jax_fully_optimized.py` - Asymmetric loss tracking
- ‚úÖ `train_jax_with_validation.py` - Validation asymmetric losses  
- ‚úÖ `run_jax_optimized.py` - Statistics collection and enhanced logging
- ‚úÖ `test_asymmetric_logging.py` - Comprehensive test suite (new)
- ‚úÖ `ASYMMETRIC_LOGGING_IMPROVEMENTS.md` - This documentation (new)

All changes are backward compatible - symmetric mode continues to work exactly as before, while asymmetric mode now provides the enhanced logging and statistics.
