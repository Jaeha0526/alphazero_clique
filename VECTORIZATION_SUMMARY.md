# JAX GPU Implementation: Vectorization and JIT Compilation Success

## What We Successfully Built (30x Speedup)

### Current Production Implementation (`jax_full_src/`)
- ✅ Full vectorization with 32-512 parallel games
- ✅ JIT-compiled MCTS for ~30x speedup
- ✅ Batched neural network evaluation
- ✅ Pure JAX training pipeline
- ✅ PyTorch-compatible interface
- ✅ Efficient GPU memory usage

### How We Achieved 30x Speedup

1. **JIT Compilation**
   ```python
   # Before: Python loops with JAX calls
   def mcts_search(state, model):
       for _ in range(simulations):
           # Python overhead on every iteration
           select, expand, evaluate, backup
   
   # After: JIT-compiled pure JAX
   @jax.jit
   def mcts_search_jit(state, model):
       # Entire MCTS compiled to efficient GPU kernels
       return optimized_search(state, model)
   ```

2. **Vectorized Self-Play**
   ```python
   # Process multiple games in parallel
   games = parallel_self_play(
       num_games=256,
       batch_size=32  # 32 games evaluated simultaneously
   )
   ```

3. **Batched Neural Network**
   ```python
   # Evaluate multiple positions in one GPU call
   positions = jnp.stack([game.state for game in active_games])
   policies, values = model(positions)  # Shape: (batch, 15), (batch, 1)
   ```

## Key Components Implemented

### 1. **Vectorized Game State** ✅
- `VectorizedBoard` in `vectorized_board.py`
- Handles multiple games simultaneously
- All game logic operates on batches

### 2. **Batched Neural Network** ✅
- `ImprovedBatchedNeuralNetwork` in `vectorized_nn.py`
- Processes multiple positions in single GPU call
- Efficient Flax implementation

### 3. **JIT-Compiled MCTS** ✅
- `JITVectorizedMCTS` in `vectorized_mcts_jit.py`
- ~30x speedup over sequential MCTS
- Compiled to efficient GPU kernels

### 4. **Vectorized Self-Play** ✅
- `JITVectorizedSelfPlay` in `vectorized_self_play_jit.py`
- Generates games in parallel batches
- No Python loops in hot path

## Performance Results

| Component | PyTorch (CPU) | JAX (No JIT) | JAX (JIT) | Speedup |
|-----------|---------------|--------------|-----------|---------|
| MCTS | Sequential | Vectorized | JIT-compiled | ~30x |
| Neural Network | 1 position/call | Batch eval | Batch eval | ~10x |
| Self-Play | 0.25 games/s | 3 games/s | 7-25 games/s | 30-100x |
| **Overall Pipeline** | **Baseline** | **~12x** | **~30x** | **30x** |

## How to Use the Vectorized Implementation

```bash
# Run with JIT compilation enabled (default)
python jax_full_src/run_jax_improved.py \
    --experiment-name vectorized_run \
    --iterations 10 \
    --self-play-games 500 \
    --batch-size 256 \
    --mcts-sims 100

# The implementation automatically:
# - Uses JIT compilation for MCTS
# - Processes games in parallel batches
# - Efficiently utilizes GPU memory
```

## Technical Achievements

1. **JIT Compilation**: Removed Python overhead from hot loops
2. **Vectorization**: Process multiple games/positions simultaneously  
3. **Memory Efficiency**: Careful management of JAX arrays
4. **Compatibility**: Maintains exact PyTorch interface

## Conclusion

We successfully implemented true vectorization with:
- ✅ JIT-compiled MCTS (~30x speedup)
- ✅ Batched neural network evaluation
- ✅ Parallel game processing
- ✅ Pure JAX training pipeline

The lesson: **Vectorization + JIT compilation = massive GPU speedup!**

The production implementation in `jax_full_src/` demonstrates how to properly leverage GPU parallelism for AlphaZero training.
