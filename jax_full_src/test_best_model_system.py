✅ Implemented Features:

1. **Best Model Tracking**:
   - Maintains a separate "best model" throughout training
   - Starts with initial model as best
   - Updates when current model beats it with >55% win rate
   - Saves best model to models/best_model.pkl

2. **Dual Evaluation**:
   - Evaluates against BOTH initial and best models
   - Provides two win rate metrics:
     * Win rate vs initial (tracks overall improvement)
     * Win rate vs best (for model selection)

3. **Model Selection**:
   - Current model must win >55% vs best to become new best
   - Provides competitive pressure for improvement
   - Prevents regression to weaker models

4. **Enhanced Plotting**:
   - Shows BOTH win rates on same plot
   - Green line: Win rate vs initial (dotted)
   - Orange line: Win rate vs best (solid)
   - All on the same 3-axis plot style

5. **Logging**:
   - Tracks best_model_iteration in log
   - Records win_rate_vs_best for each iteration
   - Saves when model becomes new best

## How It Works:

```python
# Pseudocode of the system:
for iteration in training:
    # Self-play and training...
    
    # Evaluate against BOTH models
    eval_results = evaluate_vs_initial_and_best(
        current_model=model,
        initial_model=initial_model,
        best_model=best_model
    )
    
    # Model selection
    if eval_results['win_rate_vs_best'] > 0.55:
        best_model = current_model  # Becomes new champion
        save_best_model()
```

## Benefits:

1. **Quality Control**: Only good models survive
2. **Competitive Training**: Models must beat strong opponents
3. **Progress Tracking**: See improvement vs both fixed and moving targets
4. **No Regression**: Prevents accepting worse models

## Command to Test:

```bash
python jax_full_src/run_jax_optimized.py \\
    --experiment_name test_best_model \\
    --vertices 6 \\
    --k 3 \\
    --num_iterations 5 \\
    --num_episodes 50 \\
    --num_epochs 5 \\
    --use_true_mctx \\
    --parallel_evaluation
```

Then check:
- experiments/test_best_model/models/best_model.pkl
- experiments/test_best_model/training_log.json (for win_rate_vs_best)
- experiments/test_best_model/training_losses.png (for orange line)
