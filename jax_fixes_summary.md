# JAX Implementation Fixes Summary

## Key Issues Fixed

### 1. MCTS Exploration (c_puct)
**Issue**: JAX used c_puct=1.0 while PyTorch uses c_puct=3.0
**Fix**: Updated `vectorized_mcts_jit.py` to use c_puct=3.0
**Impact**: Higher exploration will lead to more diverse move selection

### 2. Temperature Annealing
**Issue**: JAX used simple threshold (temp=1.0 if move < 10 else 0.0)
**Fix**: Implemented PyTorch's progressive annealing schedule:
- First 20%: temp=1.0
- 20-40%: temp=0.8
- 40-60%: temp=0.5
- 60-80%: temp=0.2
- Last 20%: temp=0.1
**Impact**: Better balance between exploration and exploitation throughout the game

### 3. Noise Weight Decay
**Issue**: JAX used fixed noise_weight throughout the game
**Fix**: Added noise weight decay based on game progress: `noise_weight * (1.0 - move_progress)`
**Impact**: Reduces randomness as games progress, leading to stronger endgame play

### 4. L2 Regularization
**Issue**: JAX training loss was missing L2 regularization
**Fix**: Added L2 regularization with factor 1e-5 to match PyTorch
**Impact**: Helps prevent overfitting

### 5. Gradient Clipping
**Issue**: JAX was missing gradient clipping
**Fix**: Added gradient clipping with max_norm=1.0
**Impact**: Prevents gradient explosion and training instability

### 6. Learning Rate Warmup
**Issue**: JAX used fixed learning rate from start
**Fix**: Implemented 15% warmup using optax schedules
**Impact**: More stable training start

### 7. Best Model Tracking
**Issue**: JAX didn't save best model during training
**Fix**: Added best model tracking and restoration on early stopping
**Impact**: Final model is the best performing one, not just the last iteration

### 8. Value Assignment
**Issue**: Values in alternating perspective mode were not correctly assigned
**Fix**: Fixed value assignment logic to match PyTorch implementation
**Impact**: Correct value targets for training

## Files Modified

1. `jax_full_src/vectorized_mcts_jit.py`
   - Changed c_puct from 1.0 to 3.0

2. `jax_full_src/vectorized_self_play_jit.py`
   - Added temperature annealing schedule
   - Added noise weight decay
   - Fixed value assignment for alternating perspective

3. `jax_full_src/train_jax.py`
   - Added L2 regularization
   - Added gradient clipping
   - Added warmup_fraction parameter

4. `jax_full_src/run_jax_improved.py`
   - Implemented learning rate warmup schedule
   - Added best model tracking
   - Restore best model on early stopping

## Expected Improvements

1. **Better Exploration**: Higher c_puct should lead to more diverse strategies
2. **Smoother Learning**: Temperature annealing and LR warmup should stabilize training
3. **Stronger Play**: Progressive noise reduction improves endgame performance
4. **Prevent Overfitting**: L2 regularization and gradient clipping improve generalization
5. **Optimal Model Selection**: Best model tracking ensures we keep the best performer

## Testing Recommendation

Run a comparison test:
```bash
# Original JAX (before fixes)
python jax_full_src/run_jax_improved.py --experiment-name before_fixes --iterations 10

# Fixed JAX (after fixes)
python jax_full_src/run_jax_improved.py --experiment-name after_fixes --iterations 10
```

Compare:
- Final win rates
- Training stability (loss curves)
- Game quality (move diversity)
